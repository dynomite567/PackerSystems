# ForensicDeployment
The engine for deploying forensic questions in my PackerSystems project.

I've decided to separate out the smaller projects from PackerSystems into their own repos.

This is the engine for picking and deploying two random forensic questions from questions.json
during the first boot of one of the CyberPatriot images. questions.json is the ScoringEngine repo.

### Support this project:

I plan to keep this project completely free to make use of. If you wish to support me in some way, you can become a patron of mine on Patreon here:
