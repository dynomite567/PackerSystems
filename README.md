# PackerSystems

The goal of this project is to eventually provide practice environments for things such as:

1. CyberPatriot for high school students
2. CCDC for college students
3. And an example of a small environment that one might find in the real world

Long term goals for the first two are to have a basic scoring engine that will give points as the player fixes bad practices and implements good ones
and I hope to be able to keep the example of a real environment up to date.

## Build instructions:

Install packer (packer-io on Arch Linux) and a hypervisor (Virtualbox, KVM, or VMware. I might support Parallels and Hyper-V in the future, but not yet).

Download the Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012r2 ISOs. The Ubuntu one will be gotten later.

Clone the repo and cd into it

cd into the directory of the environment you are building out

packer build -only=(virtualbox-iso, vmware-iso, or qemu) ./(machine).json

And then wait. A really long time. Repeat the last step for each image you want. If you have the resources, you can do several builds at once. If you do not specify -only, it will build all the platforms.

## Progress so far:

### CyberPatriot:

Ubuntu and Windows 10 are both functional and build the base of what I want. But only in Virtualbox for Windows 10, so now my goal is to get it working in VMware and KVM.

For Ubuntu:

    - Installs VMware tools. Vbox tools currently not working for some reason

    - Has KDE for the desktop, since I'm nice. That can be changed in the ubuntu.sh script

    - It sets up a LAMP stack

    - Puts Wordpress on that stack

    - Installs a version of bash vulnerable to Shellshock

    - Installs tigervnc

    - Installs and makes vsftpd not very secure

    - Makes SSH super insecure

    - Makes some users with weak passwords and adds them to sudo

    - Uses the hosts file to route search engines to localhost, except for Google which goes to ask.com's IP

For Windows 10:

    - Installs updates that are the latest at the time of building

    - Runs most of the scripts from https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10

        - This causes Windows Update to break and uber disables Windows Defender

    - Shares the whole C:\ drive to all the people

    - Puts the eicar test file (file that gets flagged as malware but actually does nothing) in SysWOW64

    - Makes a few fake users

    - Disables password policy

    - Sets proxy.google.com to be a web proxy

    - Routes search engines to localhost in the hosts file (except Google, which goes to ask.com's IP)

    - Disables Windows firewall

    - Installs scoop package manager for future use

For Windows Server 2012r2:

    - Does not install updates

    - Shares the whole C:\ drive to all the people

    - Puts the eicar test file (file that gets flagged as malware but actually does nothing) in system32

    - Disables password policy

    - Sets proxy.google.com to be a web proxy

    - Routes search engines to localhost in the hosts file (except Google, which goes to ask.com' IP)

    - Disables Windows firewall

    - Installs scoop package manager for future use

    - I need to research some AD PowerShell tricks to better mess up this box

### CCDC:

So I already know that getting a faithful CCDC environemnt to be built through an automated process is going to be extremely difficult. The things they do to those boxes make grown men cry (literally). But I shall do the best I can.

Creds for all these boxes is going to be "administrator" and "password" for Linux and "GingerTech" and "password" on Windows.

My current plans are something along the lines of:

Arch Database:

    - Of all the Linux OSes I have used, Arch has been the worst when it comes to hosting a database server. So it's an easy pick.

    - Most people panic when they see Arch or Gentoo because of their reputation. So of course I need at least one of them in here.

Windows 2012r2 Server:

    - Going to do AD and potentially have it be alongside a freeIPA CentOS box.

Debian workstation:

    - Was gonna do Fedora, but I guess it has really bad ESXi support (or vice versa), so I'll do Debian instead.

Windows 8.1 workstation:

    - Pretty standard.

FreeBSD BAMP server:

    - BSD, Apache, MySQL, PHP

    - Theoretically best web server you can have. Also jails are fun. Gonna need to learn a way to automate this, but it should (in theory) not be too bad.

VyOS router/firewall:

    - Gonna have to git gud at networking I guess.

Gentoo Webserver:
    
    - Gentoo is a pretty good webserver, and I automated building it, so why not?

    - People get so scared when they see Gentoo, and need to get over it.

LFS Webserver:

    - Yep.

CentOS FreeIPA:

    - Will need to learn how to IPA, but this should be fun.

CentOS Scoring Box:

    - Will not have an account for the player to use.

    - I'm thinking I'll have it host a Golang webapp that will check connections to the boxes and the needed services.

    - Automated attack engine that will not damage the boxes too badly, but will send info to the webapp about how it got in.

Feedback on this idea can be sent to me at bailey@gingertechnology.net, and I will likely make a more in depth write-up about it at https://blog.gingertechnology.net at some point.

### Scoring Engine:

My goal is to have a scoring engine for the CyberPatriot machines, and then another that checks whether services are running on the CCDC environment. I'll probably host the CCDC one on the attacking system that I plan to make.

The Linux CyberPatriot one is almost done, aside from fixing an issue with Forensic Questions. The Windows one is also functional, I just need to make the checks for it.

### Support this project:

I plan to keep this project completely free to make use of. If you wish to support me in some way, you can become a patron of mine on Patreon here:
